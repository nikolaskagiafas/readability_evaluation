This repository stems from the optional project in the course of Pattern Recognition during the 9th semester of my studies in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I developed it in cooperation with my colleague Odysseas Kyparissis. The title of the project is: "Applying readability evaluation techniques for software projects by using data mining on open source repositories".

Execute scripts by the following order:
1) FinalPreprocessing: preprocessing of the initial dataset.
2) FinalClusteringSmall: clustering the small codes data segment.
3) FinalClusteringHigh: clustering the high codes data segment.
4) FinalClassificationSmall: classifying the small codes data segment.
5) FinalClassificationHigh: classifying the high codes data segment.
6) ClusteringModelsComparison: comparing the clustering models. We run this script to decide which clustering algorithm to adopt.
7) sse_diagram: plotting SSE for diffrenent values of k.

6) and 7) are not necessary to run, in order to reach the final results.
